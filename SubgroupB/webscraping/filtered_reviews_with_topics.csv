I needed a TV urgently and saw this on Amazon so thought why not give it a try. So I ignored the reviews and thought it can't be so bad, but I was proved wrong. Absolute waste of time and and money.

Too many issues with software compatibility especially with Amazon Prime App. Was not expecting too much at such a low price but this was really bad. I mean it should at least work properly for a period of 3 to 6 months if not more? But sadly it seems to be a very badly manufactured.

The setup process was quick and easy, and I was able to start using it right away. The buttons are well-placed and easy to navigate.However, I did run into some issues with the remote. I noticed that my fire stick was trying to update the remote multiple times, but unfortunately, the updates never seemed to succeed. This was frustrating, as it seemed to happen quite often.Another issue I faced was with the volume button on the remote. Unfortunately, it did not work for me, and I'm not sure if it was supposed to work in the first place. This was a bit of a letdown, as I had hoped to be able to control my TV's volume directly from the remote.One other thing to note is the price. While this remote is the cheapest option for a fire stick remote, it is still more expensive than other TV remotes on the market. However, if you're specifically looking for a remote that will work with your fire stick, this is likely your best option.Overall, I would recommend this remote to anyone who needs a replacement remote for their 2nd generation fire stick. It may have its flaws, but it gets the job done and is easy to use once it's set up. | I had ordered this remote on March 24. Initially, the buttons were quite hard to press, I thought they would soften up in a few days, but the buttons have become even harder, now it's stopped working altogether. I can't believe Amazon can also do such a thing. | Seller is supportive. He shared detailed video on pairing the remote. It works flawlessly with 2nd gen Fire Stick and also my Sony Bravia TV. Build quality is not great but does its job. Reserving my review as I am doubtful about it's durability though. | Works good and smoothly just difficult to connect | I hate this product ,if fact the seller of this remote is cheating us very badly..... after using it for 6 times the remote control is not working . I can say this because this is the 2nd time j am buying it and it's the same issue .1st time I thought with the frst remote it would be my mistake . That I could not use it properly or it was handled by my kid who is 10years old.Keeping that in mind I bought a new remote and used it carefully single handedly but it's the same case just in 6 time use the remote is not functioning. | I am suffering after 3 months of purchase as remote is not working at all. Please purchase new fire stick instead of remote. | Easy to use.  Value for money.  Quality one. Good performance good to use.

But the amazon folks when delivered the TV, first thing mentioned was current TV stand is not good enough and forced me to buy wall mount stand and asked me to pay immediately for them to get it in next 4-5 hours. So I paid them Rs. 2800 (they said fixed). And later in the day we decided to go with new tV stand instead of wall mount installation due to challenges at home and when I informed the service personnel, they said nothing can be done as they paid the money to procure the wall mount stand already. It can‚Äôt be returned and all these happened over phone when they were still to come to my place to fix it. But after lot of dileberations, I decided to go with table stand based installation and service man agreed to return the money but after 2-3 days. After 2 days when he returned the money, he returned only 2000 Rs. as he said Amazon deducted 800 Rs. from the returned product. So be careful with Amazon and its service personnel. They will try to fleece money from you by all means.As of now, no issues with the TV though, looks good. One challenge with TV is its stand. It is very delicate. Base is not strong enough for its stable placement. | Firstly, full marks to Amazon for promptly replacing a damaged product (there was one dead pixel) without question.I have been using this TV for almost two years and am very happy with it.Pros -1. 4k screen at a reasonable price2. Lots of features and connectivity options for the price point.3. Decent speakers (I have a smallish room so the volume at a level of 35-40 is more than adequate)4. Can operate the TV through a Oneplus phone or watch also (I hardly do so though)5. Looks very sleek with minimal bezels and a narrow bottom panel. The wall mount is also of good quality.Cons1. Biggest one is the laggy UI. Not a smooth experience navigating the menus and apps. But it's not at all a deal breaker.2. Ocassional bugs. The wifi doesn't connect now and then (rare occasions though and can be rectified simoly by restarting the TV). Prime Video sometimes doesn't resume properly after you reactivate the TV from sleep and you need to restart the TV.3. Screen - I would have preferred if it had more brightness. The quality, depth and accuracy of colors, contrast ratios, etc.  will of course not match with the higher priced TVs offered by Sony, Samsung, etc.Verdict - An extremely value for money TV which has a host of connectivity features and packs an above average screen. The biggest shortcoming, even though it's far from being a deal breaker, is the best laggy an sometimes buggy UI. | If you are looking a 55 inch TV under 50k it's the bestNearly no bezelsAmazing sound qualityAmazing picture qualityMust buy if you are looking for a 55 inch tvIt was delivered in a ok ok conditionThe delivery boy took it out in a rough way but it was alright from insideThe seal was broken but no parts were missing üòÅEdit: after 1 week the tv is working awesome.

    I bought the TV unit on 14th November 2021, got myself extended warranty right-away through amazon. About the TV itself, the picture quality is okay-ish, 1080p content looked good but playing 4K content on YouTube, made the app restart ALMOST ALL THE TIME. The panel has a tendency to over saturate colours, especially red and it is NOT PLEASING and no, it's not of much help trying to configure colour settings and often glitches. The unit takes a long time to boot up which is very inconvenient in the daily run. I had a hard time switching between apps and even though it has 2GB of memory, suppose you're playing music on Spotify and switch to YouTube to just browse through the UI, without playing anything on YouTube itself, the TV will kill Spotify in the background and the music stops. Skin tones look really bad and inaccurate, by bad I mean the skin tones produced by the panel get grayish or sometimes very peachy in colour, either way it's bad. The frame around the display panel is plastic, the bottom chin has a metal trim though. Now it was all bearable until 13th of July 2022, when the display started showing glitchy patches and bands making the TV unit useless for viewing anything at all, I contacted the support team right-away, they took up the issue and told the technician would visit in a week, no one showed up. After 10  days, I got back to them and they said pick up and drop service is not available in my area and now they wanted me to wait for another 24-48 hours for an update. Eventually a technician showed up on 27th of July, took the TV unit apart and took a couple of snaps of the insides of the TV and left saying they'll get back to me with updates. On 3rd of August, I contacted them again and they said the case was closed and that I should contact the technician myself and gave me a contact number. I dialled the same number, no one responded. Then I had to again contact them on 28th of August when they claimed to have completely processed my service request and that I had confirmed the same on 25th, when I hadn't received any calls or messages from them since August 3rd when I last contacted them myself. They said they had now escalated my case. On 6th September I received a call from OnePlus telling me that the replacement TV will reach me within 6 to 10 days maximum, guaranteed. I have the call recording for the same. Now it's October 10th, three months since I reported the issue to the company. I haven't received any support from them whatsoever. Now that I looked up reviews of the same TV, I could see countless of other customers facing the exact same issue and same response from the customer care. Looking forward to filing a case legally, against the firm. Please steer clear of OnePlus products, literally dead customer care team and after sales support.

But the amazon folks when delivered the TV, first thing mentioned was current TV stand is not good enough and forced me to buy wall mount stand and asked me to pay immediately for them to get it in next 4-5 hours. So I paid them Rs. 2800 (they said fixed). And later in the day we decided to go with new tV stand instead of wall mount installation due to challenges at home and when I informed the service personnel, they said nothing can be done as they paid the money to procure the wall mount stand already. It can‚Äôt be returned and all these happened over phone when they were still to come to my place to fix it. But after lot of dileberations, I decided to go with table stand based installation and service man agreed to return the money but after 2-3 days. After 2 days when he returned the money, he returned only 2000 Rs. as he said Amazon deducted 800 Rs. from the returned product. So be careful with Amazon and its service personnel. They will try to fleece money from you by all means.As of now, no issues with the TV though, looks good. One challenge with TV is its stand. It is very delicate. Base is not strong enough for its stable placement. | Firstly, full marks to Amazon for promptly replacing a damaged product (there was one dead pixel) without question.I have been using this TV for almost two years and am very happy with it.Pros -1. 4k screen at a reasonable price2. Lots of features and connectivity options for the price point.3. Decent speakers (I have a smallish room so the volume at a level of 35-40 is more than adequate)4. Can operate the TV through a Oneplus phone or watch also (I hardly do so though)5. Looks very sleek with minimal bezels and a narrow bottom panel. The wall mount is also of good quality.Cons1. Biggest one is the laggy UI. Not a smooth experience navigating the menus and apps. But it's not at all a deal breaker.2. Ocassional bugs. The wifi doesn't connect now and then (rare occasions though and can be rectified simoly by restarting the TV). Prime Video sometimes doesn't resume properly after you reactivate the TV from sleep and you need to restart the TV.3. Screen - I would have preferred if it had more brightness. The quality, depth and accuracy of colors, contrast ratios, etc.  will of course not match with the higher priced TVs offered by Sony, Samsung, etc.Verdict - An extremely value for money TV which has a host of connectivity features and packs an above average screen. The biggest shortcoming, even though it's far from being a deal breaker, is the best laggy an sometimes buggy UI. | If you are looking a 55 inch TV under 50k it's the bestNearly no bezelsAmazing sound qualityAmazing picture qualityMust buy if you are looking for a 55 inch tvIt was delivered in a ok ok conditionThe delivery boy took it out in a rough way but it was alright from insideThe seal was broken but no parts were missing üòÅEdit: after 1 week the tv is working awesome.

    I bought the TV unit on 14th November 2021, got myself extended warranty right-away through amazon. About the TV itself, the picture quality is okay-ish, 1080p content looked good but playing 4K content on YouTube, made the app restart ALMOST ALL THE TIME. The panel has a tendency to over saturate colours, especially red and it is NOT PLEASING and no, it's not of much help trying to configure colour settings and often glitches. The unit takes a long time to boot up which is very inconvenient in the daily run. I had a hard time switching between apps and even though it has 2GB of memory, suppose you're playing music on Spotify and switch to YouTube to just browse through the UI, without playing anything on YouTube itself, the TV will kill Spotify in the background and the music stops. Skin tones look really bad and inaccurate, by bad I mean the skin tones produced by the panel get grayish or sometimes very peachy in colour, either way it's bad. The frame around the display panel is plastic, the bottom chin has a metal trim though. Now it was all bearable until 13th of July 2022, when the display started showing glitchy patches and bands making the TV unit useless for viewing anything at all, I contacted the support team right-away, they took up the issue and told the technician would visit in a week, no one showed up. After 10  days, I got back to them and they said pick up and drop service is not available in my area and now they wanted me to wait for another 24-48 hours for an update. Eventually a technician showed up on 27th of July, took the TV unit apart and took a couple of snaps of the insides of the TV and left saying they'll get back to me with updates. On 3rd of August, I contacted them again and they said the case was closed and that I should contact the technician myself and gave me a contact number. I dialled the same number, no one responded. Then I had to again contact them on 28th of August when they claimed to have completely processed my service request and that I had confirmed the same on 25th, when I hadn't received any calls or messages from them since August 3rd when I last contacted them myself. They said they had now escalated my case. On 6th September I received a call from OnePlus telling me that the replacement TV will reach me within 6 to 10 days maximum, guaranteed. I have the call recording for the same. Now it's October 10th, three months since I reported the issue to the company. I haven't received any support from them whatsoever. Now that I looked up reviews of the same TV, I could see countless of other customers facing the exact same issue and same response from the customer care. Looking forward to filing a case legally, against the firm. Please steer clear of OnePlus products, literally dead customer care team and after sales support.

This empirical study aims to investigate the health status and occupational hazards faced by these essential workers, shedding light on their physical, psychological, and socio-economic well-being. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, the research seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the challenges encountered by waste collectors, as well as potential interventions to improve their health outcomes and working conditions.The literature on waste collectors' health underscores the diverse range of occupational hazards and health risks associated with their work. Studies have documented the physical strains of manual waste handling, including musculoskeletal injuries and chronic pain, as well as the exposure to hazardous substances leading to respiratory ailments, skin infections, and gastrointestinal disorders. Moreover, the socio-economic vulnerabilities of waste collectors, such as low wages, lack of access to healthcare, and social stigma, exacerbate their health disparities and perpetuate cycles of poverty and marginalization.In Usilampatti town, waste collectors face similar challenges, compounded by the rapid urbanization and inadequate waste management infrastructure characteristic of many Indian cities. Preliminary findings from this study indicate that waste collectors in Usilampatti report a multitude of health issues, including musculoskeletal pain, respiratory illnesses, and mental stress. Their work involves physically demanding tasks, such as lifting heavy loads of waste and sorting through hazardous materials, often in unsanitary and unsafe environments. Additionally, waste collectors experience socio-economic hardships, with low wages and irregular employment exacerbating their vulnerability to health risks and limiting their access to essential healthcare services.To address these challenges, this study recommends a multi-faceted approach encompassing both policy and grassroots interventions. Improving occupational safety measures, such as providing personal protective equipment and implementing ergonomic work practices, is essential to minimizing the physical risks faced by waste collectors. Furthermore, enhancing access to healthcare services, including preventive care and treatment for work-related injuries and illnesses, is crucial for addressing their health needs and promoting overall well-being.At the policy level, measures to formalize waste collection activities, such as providing social security benefits and ensuring fair wages, can help alleviate the socio-economic vulnerabilities of waste collectors and their families. Community-based initiatives, such as training programs and awareness campaigns on waste segregation and recycling, can empower waste collectors and foster social solidarity within local neighborhoods.In conclusion, this empirical study provides valuable insights into the health status and occupational hazards of household waste collectors in Usilampatti town. By documenting their experiences and identifying potential interventions, this research contributes to efforts aimed at improving the well-being and livelihoods of waste collectors, promoting social justice, and advancing sustainable urban development in the context of solid waste management. | Within a week the product is damaged.When pull out from the Mac book pro the c drive tip is broken. | I likes the product",4.1 out of 5 stars | Previous page | Next page | Previous page | Next page | Previous page of related Sponsored Products | Next page of related Sponsored Products | Previous page | Next page | 4.1 out of 5 stars | 4.5 out of 5 stars | 4.0 out of 5 stars | 3.6 out of 5 stars | 4.3 out of 5 stars | 4.2 out of 5 stars | 4.1 out of 5 stars | Previous page of related Sponsored Products | Next page of related Sponsored Products | Previous page | 4.0 out of 5 stars | 4.1 out of 5 stars | 2.0 out of 5 stars | 3.9 out of 5 stars | Next page | 4.1 out of 5 stars | 5.0 out of 5 stars | Previous page | Next page | 4 out of 5 stars | 5.0 out of 5 stars | 4.0 out of 5 stars | 5.0 out of 5 stars | 5.0 out of 5 stars | 3.0 out of 5 stars | 1.0 out of 5 stars | 5.0 out of 5 stars | 4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 12 October 2024 | Reviewed in India on 30 August 2024 | Reviewed in India on 3 October 2024 | Reviewed in India on 4 October 2024 | Reviewed in India on 11 April 2024 | Reviewed in India on 10 April 2024 | Reviewed in India on 12 August 2024 | Reviewed in India on 1 October 2024,"{'neg': 0.181, 'neu': 0.688, 'pos': 0.13, 'compound': -0.9835}",-0.9835,negative,0

Bass and Sound quality is not very bad but also not good enough.Box items- box will have 1 BT speaker, 1 charging cable (USB to Type-C), 1 Aux cableOverall, considering the low price, this product is good.There are few small issues, which could have been solved even at low price.Cable length: both cables (charging and Aux) are smaller in size. You can see in the pic, I have kept the speaker in front of Monitor. I was thinking to keep the Speaker at one end of the table but charging/Aux cables are very small in length and I have to kept it in front of Monitor.So, if you are thinking to connect it to your TV, you will definitely have to purchase a lengthy Aux cable separately. Also, for charging, you will have to place Speaker very close to the charging port, as charging cable is not lengthy.Volume buttons- I personally keep the volume at 60-70% of Speaker, which I keep using the Total press buttons of volume (e g. if volume button has 1-10 press, then I will bring the Volume to Max and press Volume down button 3/4 times). But in this speaker, you have to long press the Volume button and there is no way to know at what level you are. | Great sound | I am appalled & disgusted with this productüò§.

Worth the money and hope it gives me good service. Connects fast with wifi and the scanner too is of high quality | I purchased the HP Deskjet 2820 Wired Colour Home Inkjet Printer recently, expecting a reliable and efficient printing solution for light home use. The printer seemed to tick all the right boxes with its compact design and advertised specifications. However, after using it for a while, my experience has been worst.1. Low Page Yield: Although the product description promises a duty cycle of up to 1000 pages per month, my total output (both B&W and color) was around 220 pages before the ink ran out. This was far below expectations. Even for light home use, I expected at least 400-500 pages per cartridge set.2. High Ink Consumption: The ink cartridges seem to deplete very quickly, especially when printing color documents. This makes it costly to maintain, as you‚Äôll need frequent refills or replacements.3. Noisy Operation: The printer can get a bit noisy during operation, which isn‚Äôt a deal-breaker but is noticeable. | The black ink cartridge  that came with it was faulty and wasn‚Äôt being recognised | Amazing printer with easy to use üëå | The 805 starter cartridge can at most print 10 pages. So, in theory, enough for you to print the alignment page and get the page scan for head alignment. Guess what, it does not even print a single page. If you are expecting any help - HP support did send someone around because I wanted to check if there is no issue with the print head. The engineer did visit and confirm and now I have ordered 805XL cartridges from HP (o not buy it from elsewhere including this vendor because third party cartridges will be rejected and you will ose your money). Instead, buy two sets and then refill them and the printer memory will not detect that this was used before. | Does printing, scanning and copy very well | WORST, WORST, WORST PRINTER AND COMPANY. I am a person who has never spent so much time on writing a review. But I am forced to. The worst printer and the worst support I have ever received. Everyday I am spending so much time to resolve one or the other issue. Now I feel the only thing HP wants is all my personal details during set up, no help after that. It has given me problems only from the first day. It took so much time to install. Once installed, when I started taking print, the paper will reach halfway to the cartridge and then will show stuck. Everytime I have to turn off the printer and restart it to print the page. I need to repeat it after every sheet.  It was resolved accidentally when my paper sheet was over and I purchased the best GSM paper from the market. Till that time, I did not receive any solution from Hp or from any other source. After that, when I was taking a print urgently, the margins of the printer never come properly as shown in the softcopy of the PDF. I took so many prints after changing the paper option to A4, letter and legal. Same results. Only after I changed the position of the paper and put it to one side of the tray, did the print come properly.  First time I am encountering a printer, for which you can put paper in different positions in the tray for the print to come properly. Usually you put the paper in the up or down tray and the print comes properly. Now I am using another wifi, not the previous one. You can scan by connecting the USB cable, but it never prints. I checked multiple sites including HP help to change my wifi. I tried multiple suggestions given, but none works out. Also, I purchased a new black cartridge from Amazon online and connected it properly, but the cartridge status shows a red light. Dont know why.  I have used printers in India and abroad, both laser and inkjet. HP printers were always notorious for installation, but never gave me this much trouble.

    I had purchased a geyser in late 2021 and it hasn't been used much. Now, it wasn't switching on during October 2023. So, when the technician visited on 16th Oct, he promptly took Rs 350 as service charge and said that Geyser tank has an issue and it needs to be replaced. I told him to do it as soon as possible as winter was about to start. He told that it would take 2 weeks maximum as it was an online purchase. But, insisted that it would be done by 2 weeks and we should not worry.Now, I received another call, directly from Service centre on 20th Oct. The person stated that replacement request has been accepted. I would receive the product by 1 week.5 days later (on 25th Oct), I called the service centre around 1:40 pm - No one picked the call.I again called at 6:30 pm multiple times. Finally, one person picked and he said that since you didn't receive Replacement tag on whatsapp, it will take more time. I asked about why do I need the tag, it's them to receive it and come with the replacement product and install it. However, they said that they cannot do anything. Also, they said that tag was generated a few days back and since I didnt follow up with them, so it was not sent. Sounds ridiculous right. I asked them to share the tag now which they again unnecessarily delayed till next day evening. Also, I had called them multiple times. That day (26th Oct), they confirmed again that it will take a week to replace the product.Now, again I followed up yesterday (2nd Nov). They didn't pick up and call and just read all my whatsapp messages but didn't respond.Today( 3rd Nov) I received a call from the technician who had visited on the first day. He said that it will take another 7 days. He was extremely rude and when I asked him to listen to my words as well, he disconnected the call. RIDICULOUS behaviour !!!Bajaj product quality can be seen in the image/video attached. It looks like a refurbished product with very old parts. Utterly PATHETIC product and extremely DISGUSTING service. They are not able to send a replacement in almost 3 weeks but able to send new deliveries in a day or two.I would suggest other buyers to refrain from buying Bajaj products. If at all you want to buy one, do it offline. Atleast, you know the seller.Btw, thanks Bajaj for wasting my time and energy. Your product and service centre guys are MISERABLE. Additionally, your call centre team is clueless. They only say one thing that the buyer needs to directly talk and deal with service centre. Simply no ownership.Finally, I bought another Racold geyser and still waiting for the wretched Bajaj team to resolve the issue. Sad story of a customer._________________________I kept folowing up and no one was picking the call or reverting on messages. Just silently reading my whatsapp messages. Once I did whatsapp call on 10th Nov and they picked it by mistake. I asked that you have told during our last communication (which was 3rd Nov) that it would be installed in a week. Any progress ?? He just randomly told that it would be done today or max tomorrow as now the bill has also been generated from Bajaj side. And, he disconnected the call.Again, no progress for 6 days. Out of frustration, I called him again in early morning on Nov 16th. He picked by mistake and enquired who am I. The moment he realized, he told to call me after 11am. Then I called the technician who had originally visited and told that product would be replaced in 10-15 days. Finally, they agreed to install the replacement order on next day.So, on 17th Dec ( more than a month), the replacement geyser was installed. They kept saying that this delay was due to Diwali. I told them that the replacement tag was generated on 19th Nov and by no means Diwali was celebrated for 29 days. Anyways, I understood that Bajaj service is extremely PATHETIC when you are trying to claim anything under guarantee. So, please do not purchase Bajaj products online. This is my ordeal. | Quick delivery. I am happy with the product. It storage capacity it is good for family size of 2-4.Heating speed is good and ease to use thorough switch. | Useful for small family or single use .As needs to reheat after 1 bucket water | The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
            
        
    
    








  
  
    The product was installed today, on time installation and very fast product delivery but installation is bit costlier so be prepared for same.I was charged 350‚Çπ for installation, pipe for 230‚Çπ and adjustable valve for 550‚Çπ approx 1130‚Çπ for installation. Bajaj must have kept this pricing fix and when i called bajaj for price confirmation they say you need to talk with technician we dont know charges.Charges in your area may differ bit | Awesome",4.1 out of 5 stars | Previous page | Next page | Previous page | Next page | 3.8 stars | Previous page | 4.0 | 4.2 | Next page | Previous page of related Sponsored Products | Next page of related Sponsored Products | 4 out of 5 stars. | 3.8 out of 5 stars. | 4 out of 5 stars. | Previous page | 4.3 out of 5 stars | 4.0 out of 5 stars | 3.6 out of 5 stars | 3.5 out of 5 stars | 3.8 out of 5 stars | Next page | Previous page of related Sponsored Products | Next page of related Sponsored Products | 4.1 out of 5 stars | 4.3 out of 5 stars | 4.4 out of 5 stars | 4.2 out of 5 stars | 4.4 out of 5 stars | 4.2 out of 5 stars | 4.1 out of 5 stars | 5.0 out of 5 stars | Previous page | Next page | 1 out of 5 stars | 5.0 out of 5 stars | 4.0 out of 5 stars | 5.0 out of 5 stars | 1.0 out of 5 stars | 1.0 out of 5 stars | 5.0 out of 5 stars | 4.0 out of 5 stars | 3.0 out of 5 stars | 5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 17 October 2024 | Reviewed in India on 5 October 2024 | Reviewed in India on 20 October 2024 | Reviewed in India on 3 November 2023 | Reviewed in India on 17 September 2024 | Reviewed in India on 19 September 2024 | Reviewed in India on 9 March 2024 | Reviewed in India on 17 October 2024,"{'neg': 0.086, 'neu': 0.825, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': -0.4437}",-0.4437,negative,2

Shopping & delivery:  Good. Got product delivered in 2-3 days2. Installation: installed on the same day as promised by the technician and managerial team due to earlier experience of need for return of Aquasure SmartPlus. Good service overall. Polite technician. Explained stuff well.3. Product Review: Water taste is also not bad. So far it's working well and fine (used for 2 days now)A. Pros: *  Fills water in the tank (7 L) fast. *  Can be wall mounted / table top as required. *  Size is manageable only. *  Silent operation *  Value for moneyB. Cons: *  Water wastage is pretty high as other RO devices.  May be more water is wasted than purified. *  The tap provided to take water is not comfortable.  Water spills everytime you close the tap after  filling up the cup/bottle/whatever.Will be updated if need arises. | I rarely post review but I think this review might help you with your decision if you want to buy this purifier or not.The Purifier works fine. However it seems its better suited to places where there is no water pressure and water supply issue.I will provide review on basic things which make a purifier good.i) Installation - Was done by AG guy and seems not too troublesome. Will see if it changes in case I move.ii) Storage Capacity - It seems just enough, but for a family 2-3 people, in summers, this capacity is not enough.iv) Servicing - My purifier once stopped working on Sunday morning so called AG guy and I had to wait for another day for the visit as Sunday was off day. It eventually started working before the visit, so the visit didn't add anything. [UPDATE ON SERVICING]: I think the servicing day issue was due to COVID pandemic, and I have been told they will be available to service the purifier on both days of weekend as well. So that should put your mind at ease about servicing.Last and most important:v) Purifying mechanism - Its a little cumbersome and takes time to know how this thing works. so know this, it works best if water enters in full flow to purifier inlet. The LED 2nd from top which says ""Purifying"" flickers at a frequency depending on pressure. If there is very low pressure, the LED will beep at every 6-8 seconds and might even not been at all. If its medium pressure, it will beep at every 2-3 seconds. And if pressure is good/high, it will do continuous beep without flicker.Here are some issues or hints (depends) to help you know the working of this purifier.i) Problem 1 - There is no way to make it purify faster if flow pressure is low.ii) Problem 2 - Once pressure is too low the purifier will stop purifying, but once pressure comes back, many a times it won't resume purifying. so you have to switch it off and keep it off till power LED goes off and turn it on again.iii) Problem 3 - with low pressure once purifier stops working, most of the times it needs you to open the tap (and wait till water comes with full force and leave it like that for about 5 seconds and then close the tap) to help it with maintaining minimum necessary water pressure.All above problems occur if your Purifier inlet is set directly on water supply line which will have varying pressure through out the day depending when your home gets water. But if you have a storage before this purifier to feed water to it and that is at sufficient height or have a way to push water with sufficient pressure, you will not face any of the above listed problems.Once you know above three problems and way to workaround them wherever you can, it looks to be a decent purifier. and Generally with every purifier, it takes a little time (couple of weeks) to understand how it works or doesn't work.Hope this review helps. | Update 4th month of use! Don't Buy! Customer service is hollow.a little over a month into purchase, the device started beeping continuously when refilling and just wouldn't stop. the first time we asked for support, nobody showed up for a week, and when they did they said its a new faulty fuse used only in this model and that most products in the city have this fault and are pending. waited three weeks before contacting them for an update, another guy comes to diagnose AGAIN and he doesn't put the device back together again, so now device overflowed and didn't even start had to beg to solve the new problems and leave me with the beeping only problem. , now it has stretched to three months. every time i reach out to customer service to repeat my horror to them of no avail. they try to say that the water is still fit for use, just ignore the beep. is this what we pay for? to be treated like this?------------------------------------------Has been nearly a month now. Installation was delayed by Eureka stating the cause of COVID. Technician didn't test water hardness / suggest the need for a pre-filter as some other reviews mentioned. Out of the box, the unit had some minor scratches and two tiny dents. I considered returning but took a chance with the product since I needed the unit asap. After about 10 days of delivery, was installed, quite professionally with least disturbance to the fittings and all. Everything was explained quite well. There is a diverter valve included in the package to fit with a source. For some reason, this diverter valve broke a couple of days ago, I am not entirely sure if it was a manufacturing defect or the cause of someone using the tab it was installed with. However, I had a tough time finding an after market valve to fit the original tubes. Have obtained an original valve from Eurkea, will have to install it now.The purifier itself is very silent and fast, fills up from empty in nearly 15 minutes, Storage quantity is more than demanded for a family of 5. Quality of water is good, tastes almost like any other RO water. Unit is light in weight and compact. | Good looking product. Tank is transparent to view the water level. Wall mountable, no need for stand. Eureka Forbes technician installed the unit after 2 days of delivery. The technician Mr.Solai was very professional and neatly fitted the system including a pre-filter which is not included in the package. Got pre-filter on additional payment. This RO + UV purifies nicely and the water taste is good. The technician has set the taste by adjusting MTDS. Overall, it's a value for money product.Cons:The water cut off sensor failed within 10 months. I raised a complaint on 7th Apr 2023 but still no response to replace the sensor.5 star for Amazon delivery5 star for installationBut1 star for service",3.9 out of 5 stars | Previous page of related Sponsored Products | Next page of related Sponsored Products | Previous set of slides | 4.4 out of 5 stars | 4.3 out of 5 stars | 4.0 out of 5 stars | 3.9 out of 5 stars | 3.9 out of 5 stars | 4.2 out of 5 stars | Next set of slides | Previous page | 4.5 out of 5 stars | 4.2 out of 5 stars | 4.2 out of 5 stars | 4.5 out of 5 stars | 4.0 out of 5 stars | Next page | Previous page of related Sponsored Products | Next page of related Sponsored Products | 3.9 out of 5 stars | 4.1 out of 5 stars | 4.2 out of 5 stars | 3.9 out of 5 stars | 4.1 out of 5 stars | 4.2 out of 5 stars | 3.9 out of 5 stars | 5.0 out of 5 stars | Previous page | Next page | 3 out of 5 stars | 5.0 out of 5 stars | 5.0 out of 5 stars | 4.0 out of 5 stars | 1.0 out of 5 stars | 1.0 out of 5 stars | 5.0 out of 5 stars | 5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 31 May 2021 | Reviewed in India on 28 May 2020 | Reviewed in India on 28 June 2020 | Reviewed in India on 12 June 2022,"{'neg': 0.112, 'neu': 0.794, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': -0.9718}",-0.9718,negative,2

    A good product. First of all, one cannot compare this vacuum cleaner with 220v house vac cleaner. Suction power is definitely low but it does suck all the sand on car floor mats and seats. It is slow as compared to home vac cleaner but does the job for which it is made for.Dont buy if you are looking for quick and high pressure cleaning for your vehicle.Secondly dont opt for extended warranty as this product has 6 months warranty, and extended warranty is only for those products which have minimum of 1 year manufacturer warranty.Happy Purchase. | Wire is being heating up and smoke is coming from the machine. Suction also not as expected | Very poor suction quality but sturdy built | Hmm,Strudy design, quality accessories,reputated brand.I have seen some car vaccum cleaners especially the low cost one's where dust comes out of machine due to poor locking mechanism, so ofcourse you don't want the dust to be falling back when the sole purpose is to remove it!!!You get what you pay for, I have home vaccum clear from same company with has a good suction and does the job well, I wanted a battery pluggable clearner where I can use it anywhere.Believe me no vaccum cleaner is good enough for heavily soiled cars, so if you are expecting a commercial level cleaning the don't buy any.Car vaccum cleaner is a portable device which gives decent satisfaction but not a perfect, I have seen some people who do not take out mats and just shove the cleaner in it and say it's not good.Mats need to be take out which actually collects big dust and derbies, this poor small machine can't handle a 100% cleaning on that.If the car is heavily soiled the you must get it cleaned at a professional clearner then start using the small one.I found this to be doing the job when compared to my house vaccum clearner.One thing I observed was the wires was getting hot and has a soft component which makes it even thinner when it's hit but I think I can handle the job, accessories quality is good and fir and finishe is good.I did not seen any dust seeping through the compartment and it was well contained in the dust chamber.Suction is decent and you can give almost a clean and tidy look to your car with this machine, again a professional grade cleaners can doa good job which cost nothing less tha 15K.I would say worth a buy it used delligently by not expecting too much.I only hope if the company can provide a bag to carry it for the price or find one in your own which can fit your needs. | Its a very good and reliable product using it from last 3 years | It is a quality product which removes the smallest or dust and dirt particles from the car.

Let see in future how long it keeps water alkaline. However few smaller issues were there. Like packaging was very fragile and almost open. Second, after filling water when I looked at purifying candle I found water dripping from top of candle also. Then I disassembled it and tightened the candle. So these are primary issues. No ‚Äúhow to use guide‚Äù inside so figure out yourself. | This is the second time i m ordering this pitcher. Its an amazing product , pocket friendly, easy to handle, no complex installation, crystal clear water, good for compact homes.It is sturdy. | First of all, the product didn‚Äôt come with an instruction manual and so I spent quite some time searching for how to operate this piece. All that I could find was a small flow chart kind of thing on the carton and nothing else. While pealing off the cartridge‚Äôs seal as asked, I noticed a lot of particles/dust on the seal which clearly meant the filter was defective. Further, I noticed that the cartridge/filter wasn‚Äôt properly fit and while adjusting the same, I heard some rattle, similar the sound of grinding/crackling pepper. Nevertheless, I have added water to the jar from the top and and the water that was filtered through the cartridge was dark in colour with a lot of dark particles/suspended dust. It was kind of really scary. I wasn‚Äôt sure if that was normal, read online and learned that the water filtered through the cartridge was supposed to be clear since the cartridge is supposed to only change water‚Äôs pH and doesn‚Äôt actually add anything to water. Discarded the filtrate and tried once again but the same thing happened. The device is clearly defective and there‚Äôs no way you can return the same for a refund after purchasing, only a replacement can be sought and am not sure if that would work properly. Never expected KENT to deliver this kind of outdated, faulty, defective and rather dangerous thing without proper quality checks putting the health of customers at a risk and danger. Frankly, I am clueless what could have happened if I consumed the dark water with dark particles/dust. | The spare cartridge not available, it's scrap after 30days of life. you'll have to buy the new jug everytime.
